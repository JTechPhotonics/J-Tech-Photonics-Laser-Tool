# J Tech Photonics Laser Tool
## Wrapper - 2.0 release candidate

Previous versions of this extension were based on fairly ancient and unreadable code. The extension is now a wrapper 
around the new [svg-to-gcode](https://github.com/PadLex/SvgToGcode) library. Legacy version will of course remain 
available even after this branch is merged with the master branch.


## Installation

Download the latest beta release [here](https://github.com/JTechPhotonics/J-Tech-Photonics-Laser-Tool/releases).
Inkscape versions below 1.0 are not supported. Use legacy releases if you are using Inkscape < 1.0.

Unzip the binaries and copy the laser directly into the Inkscape **user extensions folder**. Inkscape lists the location
of your user extensions folder under **Edit** > **Preferences** > **System**.

Restart Inkscape and you're done.
